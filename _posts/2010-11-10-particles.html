<p>
	A little project which can produce different-looking and -behaving particles.
</p>
<p>
	Every particle is influenced by outside-factors such as gravity and wind
	and bounces of the ground (or not) accordingly to its bounciness.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore I made a &#39;tornado-emitter&#39; whose particles fly in a
	tornadlo-like manner.
