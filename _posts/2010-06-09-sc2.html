<p>
	Space Confusion 2 is an arcade-like 3D Space-Shooter. The player's aim is to
	survive as long as possible and make extra points by destroying meteorits.
</p>
<p>
	You are navigating through a field of meteorits and lose health over time and even more
	when you collide with a meteorit. To avoid this collisions you are given a laser-gun
	to destroy the deadly meteorits.
</p>
<p>
	Since this was my first 3D-project my goal was just to get accustomed to 3D-programming with
	<a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My main challenges were the collision detection & response in 3D and a proper
	aiming-system.
