	From August 2011 to January 2012 I interned at <a href="http://www.goodgamestudios.com/">Goodgame Studios</a> in Hamburg, Germany. I worked on the backend-side of the browser game <a href="http://gangster.goodgamestudios.com/">Goodgame Mafia</a> (now called Goodgame Gangster). My responsibilities included:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Developing and updating the server components</li>
	<li>working closely with (flash) client developers and game design</li>
	<li>maintaining and extending the game database (MySQL)</li>
</ul>

		In Goodgame Gangster you live the thrilling life of a gangster in a big city. Do missions for the godfather, duel with other players and get new items at the blackmarket to improve your character. Build up a clan and make it the greatest family in the city. Start your career and become the biggest gangster of all time.
