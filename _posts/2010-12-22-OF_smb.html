<p>
	Well, the title pretty much says it. This is the first level of Super Mario Bros.
	programmed with openFrameworks.
</p>
<p>
	The game provides a 2-player mode, where 2 players can run through the level and whoever
	reaches the end first, wins.
</p>
<p>
	There are also goombas running around, just waiting to be flattened!

		This project is actually composed of several smaller projects I and my fellow
		student <a href="http://benjy.multimediatechnology.at/">Benjamin Medicke</a> made 
		for our game development course (asset-manager, scrolling backgrounds, spritesheet-animation, map-editor).
