	Stealth Granny is an isometric Stealth-Game. The player is controlling
	an elderly woman who tries to escape a retirement home and has to make her way
	past the guards.
</p>
<p>
	We wanted to write our own map-editor. Unfortunately we ended up investing the 
	most part of development time in the editor. But the result was a quite 
	powerful isometric map-editor, which we used to build our levels with.
</p>
<p>
	I developed this project with two fello students of mine:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://ryambaco.multimediatechnology.at/">Christian Mayr</a> and</li>
		<li><a href="http://benjy.multimediatechnology.at/">Benjamin Medicke</a></li>
	</ul>

		Several interesting challenges occured in this project. One was a sight-detection
		for our enemies (quite important in a stealth-game!).
		We realised this with a
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm">Bresenham</a>-algorithm
		implementation, mapped to our iso-coordinates.
	</p>
	<p>
		The isometric perspective was another challenge, since none of us had ever worked on an isometric
		game before.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another pretty cool feature is the A.I. of our enemies.
		It's realised with a state-pattern, so every enemy can act individually
		according to its current state.
		For enemy-movement we also implemented an
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_star">A*</a>-algorithm for pathfinding.
