	I started my master's degree programme in October 2013. As one of the first assignments we had to develop a task-tracking app. Its intended use was for a customer at our University who would use it to track their research-tasks and the time spent on them. I used this opportunity to fiddle around with the popular MVC-framework <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. The requirements were along the following lines:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Create tasks and subtasks and nest them up to 3 layers deep.
	</li>
	<li>
	Track the time for every task individually.
	</li>
	<li>
	Provide an overview for every task which displays the currently accumulated time as well as every date this task has tracked on.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you want to give it a try, I've <a href="http://joe-z.multimediatechnology.at/timetracking/">hosted the project at my university webspace</a>. The app will accept just about any fake e-mail-address you can come up with, so don't worry about account creation!
