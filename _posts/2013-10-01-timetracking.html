<p>
	I started my master's degree programme in October 2013. As one of the first assignments we had to develop a task-tracking app. Its intended use was for a customer at our University who would use it to track their research-tasks and the time spent on it. I used this opportunity to fiddle around with the popular MVC-framework <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. The requirements were along the following lines:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	It should be possible to create tasks and subtasks and nest them up to 3 layers deep.
	</li>
	<li>
	Make it possible to track the time for every task individually.
	</li>
	<li>
	Provide an overview for every task which displays the currently accumulated time as well as every date this task has tracked on.
	</li>
</ul>

<span id = "more">more</span>
<div id = "moreInfo" style="display: none;">
	<p>
		Our team consisted of the following people:
        <p>Martin Kolb (Setting up the work environment, HTML-dummies)</p>
        <p><a href="http://flanzendorfer.com/" class="rounded button">Franz Lanzendorfer</a> (AngularJS-development)</p>
        <p><a href="http://toeroek.eu/" class="rounded button">Markus Török</a> (CSS / Bootstrap-Design, additional AngularJS-development)</p>
	</p>
	<span id="less">less</span>
</div>
