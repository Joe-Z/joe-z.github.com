	Piratenkampf! makes you the commander of a desert island. After a horrible crash,
	you lost all of your crew and all you could save was your lifeboat, your cannon and some barrels.
	If that wasn't enough, your archenemy also stranded on an island right in front of you.
</p>

<p>
	The core gameplay is match-three: The player can combine barrels of different types to trigger various effects to gain an advantage over her enemy.
	The two islands fight against each other, and whoever combines and manages his barrels best, will eventually be the winner.
</p>
<p>
	This game supports network play as well as a singleplayer mode against AI opponents with 3 different difficulty settings.
</p>
<p>
	Please note that the game is still under development and the screenshots show a work in progress.
